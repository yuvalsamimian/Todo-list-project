# ToDo List Application

Welcome to the ToDo List Application! This project allows users to manage their tasks with a simple and interactive ToDo list. Users can add, complete, delete, and filter tasks, and the tasks are saved in the browser's local storage to persist across page reloads.

## Features

- **Add ToDo Items**: Add new tasks to your list.
- **Complete ToDo Items**: Mark tasks as completed by clicking a checkmark button.
- **Delete ToDo Items**: Remove tasks from the list with a trash button.
- **Filter ToDos**: Filter tasks to show all, completed, or uncompleted items.
- **Local Storage**: Tasks are saved to local storage so that they persist even after refreshing the page.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list-project.git
